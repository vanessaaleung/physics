# One-dimensional motion
## Vectors and Scalars
- Vecotors: Magnitude(size) and **Direction**, e.g. 5 meters to the left, 2.5 meters/second to the left
- Scalars: Magnitude(size), e.g. 5 meters, 2.5 meters/second

## Distance and Displacement
- Distance travelled: total length of the journey
- Displacement: Change in position, includes direction

# Forces and Newton's Laws of Motion
## Newton's First Law of Motion
> Every object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change its state by the action of an external force

## Newton's Second Law of Motion
> Force = mass * acceleration

- mass: how much stuff there is
- weight: how much stuff that is pulled down by the gravity

## Newton's Third Law of Motion
> To every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction: or the forces of two bodies on each other are always equal and are directed in opposite directions
